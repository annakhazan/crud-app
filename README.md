# Anna Khazan's CRUD Application

This application allows you to interact with a record of inventory products. You can add new products as they come in, update existing records, delete products that are no longer available, or simply view what is currently stored in inventory.

## Installation

Download the source code:

```shell
git clone git@github.com:annakhazan/crud-app.git
```

Finally, download the [example `products.csv` file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/prof-rossetti/nyu-info-2335-70-201706/master/projects/crud-app/products.csv) and save it as `data/products.csv`.

## Usage

```shell
python app/products_app.py
```

The program will then direct you to choose one of the several available operations, and will prompt you for further information if relevant.
